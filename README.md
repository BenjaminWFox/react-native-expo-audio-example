## React Native / Expo Audio

A simple example used to illustrate Expo `Audio` issues on Android.

On first load this has been *mostly* working for me. Sounds gradually stop working over time.

Subsequent loads without force-quitting the Expo app do not work at all.

Force-quitting the Expo app seems to restore the mostly working state.

I have not experienced issues with this on IOS.
